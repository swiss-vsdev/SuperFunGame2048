By Gabriel Zeizer and Aurélien Santi

# Description and *How To Play*
The game is a basic 2048 game
You can play the game with arrows W A S D :
Each one of these keys will throw the tiles to the equivalent direction
W will send them to the top of the board
A will send to the left
S Down
D Right

When the numbers are throwed to the border, if 2 équivalent numbers touch each other they will merge together

The goal it to make appear the 2048 number on your board.

It's not that easy and it requires a bit of strategy.
The biggest number you can do is 131072 but don't worry : You will not :) !
You think you can ? Prove it !
